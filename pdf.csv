2e201418-ceac-42d9-b897-6cf57342e2ab,"This research presents the design and development of a robot for the collection of surface aquatic sediments in shallow water environments. The robot ’ s primary function is to enhance traditional sampling techniques and ensure precise data for environ- mental assessment. The robot ’ s working principle involves being manually placed at the sampling point, where it descends under its own weight through the water column until reaching the sediment bed. At this point, it employs an innovative drilling system that combines rotational and linear movements, enabling a conical-shaped collector to gather samples from the uppermost 52 mm of sediment while minimizing the loss of  ﬁ ne sediment. Primarily constructed with 3D-printed parts, the robot features a modular layered design in its mechanical structure, facilitating both assembly and maintenance. The control system is composed of a Raspberry Pi (RPI), a stepper motor driver, an H-bridge, and optical sensors for position and velocity feedback. Additionally, a monitoring system was implemented through a local Wi-Fi network to visualize drilled distance, linear velocity, angular velocity, and battery voltage during the sampling process. Multiple tests have been carried out in the laboratory, where the amount of sediment collected ranged from 84.2 to 151 g depending on the sampling duration, demonstrating the robot ’ s capability and consistency in meeting standard requirements.",0,217,0.329,0,0,0.773,0.9167124529594798,1,0,1

This problem has been increasing in recent years due mainly to anthropogenic sources, such as industry and growing cities [1, 2]. These pollutants are harmful to the ecosystem because they end up in estuaries or coastal waterways, creating a potential risk for biota [3]. Various inves- tigations around the world have studied the level of contami- nation by heavy metals [4 – 7] and microplastics [8, 9], evidencing a problem coming from various sources of contam- ination and in different aquatic environments such as rivers, lakes, oceans, or reservoirs.",0,104,0.365,0,0,0.402,0.4852013038742579,0,0,1
75b9b470-b990-433b-9514-40fee950ce35,"The previously mentioned investigations used the analysis of surface sediments as a method to identify the contaminants present in the ecosystem. The surface sediments, representing the uppermost 2 – 3 cm of the bottom sediment layer, have the capacity to absorb or retain hydrophobic chemical contami- nants, allowing, through their collection and analysis, to obtain information on the possible contaminants present in the envi- ronment, and that could pose a risk to the ecosystem [10]. Most sediment collectors can be used for surface sediment collection; however, they have some limitations.

On the other hand, grab samplers may suffer from sealing issues due to wear or the presence of solid particles, potentially leading to sample loss [11], as seen in Figure 1. A similar issue occurs with core samplers, which are limited to a certain grain size, causing the loss of  ﬁ ner sediment. In those cases, sediment loss during tool elevation results in the release of  ﬁ ne particles and contaminants from the sample into the surrounding water, leading to an underestimation of the ﬁ ner particles in the sample [12]. The implementation of robotic devices for sediment sam- ple collection offers signi ﬁ cant potential to enhance the ef ﬁ - ciency of the sampling process through automation. Previous research has explored a variety of innovative designs and con- ﬁ gurations to address this challenge. For instance, one study developed a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) equipped with an adjustable buoyancy system and an optimized sampling core, enabling the robot to submerge and insert the collector to retrieve sediment samples [13]. Another approach combined two robots: a ground vehicle designed to extract and transport sediment using an aluminum tube with a wedge to minimize sample loss, and an aerial drone tasked with capturing images to assist operators in de ﬁ ning sampling routes and objectives [14]. Researchers have also tested a robotic system that inte- grates linear and rotational motion to penetrate the sediment, employing a perforated tube design, although this design still presents opportunities for improvement [15]. Furthermore, a lightweight and portable ROV powered by dual thrusters has been employed to provide the vertical force necessary for sediment penetration, with additional experiments evaluating the maximum penetration depth achievable using this thruster system together with a core collector featuring helical  ﬁ ns [16, 17]. In addition, an underwater robot with articulated limbs and a claw-type grabbing mechanism has been developed to collect marine sediment samples speci ﬁ cally aimed at micro- plastic analysis [18]. Complementing these hardware advance- ments, further studies have focused on optimizing the",1,343,0.365,0,0,0.402,0.48522627821579234,0,0,0

Despite the advances in automation mentioned earlier, most current robotic collectors still rely on traditional sampling tools, such as corers and grabs, and therefore continue to face issues related to the loss of  ﬁ ne particles. Although these tools have undergone certain optimizations, there remains room for improvement in the design of the sampler tip to enhance mate- rial retention during collection.

Figure 2 shows the principle of operation of the robot. Figure 2 shows the main magnitudes that describe the operation of the system.

In addition, the pitch distance of the threaded rods, referred to as  p linear , is observed to be 20 mm.

The main parameters of the tip design are shown in Figure 3, where a helicoid pitch distance  p drill  of 20 mm is shown, along with the protruding cavities through which the sediment enters. Certainly, the use of plastics harms the environment, par- ticularly when they are employed as tools for microplastic con- tamination analysis. In the present study, the sediment collector has been fabricated with polylactic acid  ﬁ lament (PLA) using a 3D printer. This was done only for validation purposes in a controlled environment before being scaled to real-world applications using more sustainable materials. Once the system parameters have been identi ﬁ ed, the oper- ating speeds of both motors are calculated to synchronize their motion and minimize resistance during the drilling and sedi- ment sample collection.

88be5dbb-bb98-4eaf-a163-4ed932c75398,"2.2.1. Base.  The base is the part located at the bottom of the robot, its main function is to provide the robot with greater robustness and resistance to overturning, which can be caused by drilling the sediment. To achieve this, transverse aluminum square rods were attached to the bottom of the base, thus increasing the area in contact with the sediment and therefore the stability of the robot. In addition, the base was designed to support structural elements that were assembled with the rest of the robot, which are four vertical square rods, two smooth rods, two threaded screws (coupled to bearings), and the side upper and lower acrylics. Since this component is the  ﬁ rst to make contact with the sedimentary surface, a bottom detection system was implemen- ted using two magnetic switches (bottom detection sensors). These sensors are activated when a mobile piece, attached to a magnet located at the bottom, triggers them as the robot",4,158,0.365,0,0,0.402,0.4852095947452765,0,1,0

The mobile layer is the component that moves vertically during the collection process, its main func- tion is to support the DC motor and the collection tip coupled to its shaft. To provide linear movement, this piece is subject to 2 spindle, which move by the action of the rotation of the threaded screws coming from the stepper motor. As seen in Figure 7, this layer is equipped with two sensors: one coupled to a perforated strip, so that it acts as a linear encoder, which allows the measurement of the vertical distance drilled and the linear speed; and a rotational encoder, located in the initial part of the DC motor shaft. Also located in this layer is an activation tab that is detected by the upper and lower limit optical sensors, indicating the end of the vertical travel of the mobile layer.",4,146,0.365,0,0,0.402,0.9168826447044376,0,1,0

For this, the robot was put in manual mode, and the mobile layer was lowered using the control knobs. Once down, the collecting tip was removed and the collected sediment was weighed. Regarding the measured drilling distance, it does not repre- sent the depth drilled into the sediment, as the collecting tip is offset from the sedimentary surface, starting at an initial position 90mm above the surface (Figure 14). Therefore, to determine the effective drilling distance, the initial offset of the collector (90mm) is subtracted from the total drilled distance (230mm), resulting in an effective drilling distance of ~140mm. To estimate the depth of the collected sediment, refer to Figure 14. This  ﬁ gure shows that the drilling distance required for sediment to enter the collector through the holes in the collecting tip ranges from 88 to 117.8 mm. By subtracting this range from the effective drilling distance (140 mm), the approximate depth of the collected sediment is calculated, resulting in a sample depth range of 22.2 to 52 mm.",15,187,0.365,0,0,0.402,0.9168636214789103,0,0,0

Regarding data communication and visuali- zation, real-time graphs of drilled distance, linear velocity, angular velocity, and battery voltage were displayed through a web browser, as shown in Figure 15. Addition- ally, the collected data from each test was stored for further analysis. Furthermore, after each test, upon removing the collection tip from the mechanism, sediment accumulated during the sequence was observed on the tip (Figure 16), In particular, Figure 16c shows the presence of clay in the collected sample, demonstrating the mechanism ’ s ability to capture  ﬁ ner particles. After conducting the collection tests, with varying collec- tion state durations as established, the results for each collection time (0, 5, 10, and 15 s) are shown in Figures 17 – 20.

99c9eb0d-db44-4380-8637-6e8b14da70e1,"A surface sediment collection robot for shallow waters was designed and implemented, assembled mainly with 3D printed parts. The results of the tests conducted with varying collection times indicate that the maximum capacity of the collection tip is reached at 10 s. At 0 s of collection state, the amount of sediment gathered was signi ﬁ cantly low, with an average of 84.2g. As the collection time increased to 5 s, the sediment mass increased to an average of 139.3g. Further increases in collection time showed a smaller difference, as the average masses at 10 and 15 s were 151 and 149g, respectively. This suggests that extending the collection time beyond 10 s does not lead to a meaningful increase in sample volume. Additionally, the low variability in the collected masses within each time group indicates that the collection mecha- nism, based on a linear and rotational movement for drilling the sediment, using a conical-shaped collection tip with helical ﬁ ns, works effective, and consistently. This result demonstrates",17,168,0.365,0,0,0.402,0.9168401222003179,0,0,1
